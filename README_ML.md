- **Apache Cassandra Lunch Online Meetup #12: Cassandra & Kubernetes**
    - We cover Kubernetes, discussing what it is and how it works with Docker and Cassandra. We also looked at some of Kubernetes' competitors and a variety of open sources tools for Kubernetes which will give you an insight as to why we picked Kubernetes to be a worth while investment when working with databases.

- **Apache Cassandra Lunch Online Meetup #15: Cassandra Backup and Restoration**
    - We discuss Cassandra Backup / Restoration. We also discuss disaster avoidance, disaster recovery, and different tools that can be used for backup and restoration of your Cassandra data. Also, we discuss an example scenario of how someone has set up multi-node clusters and how they go about data backup and restoration.

- **Apache Cassandra Lunch Online Meetup #16: Cassandra Anti-Entropy, Repair, and Synchronization**
    - We discuss Cassandra Anti-entropy which is a process of comparing the data of all replicas and updating each replica to the newest version. We also looked at repair and synchronization in Cassandra and how you can prepare for the unexpected.

- **Apache Cassandra Lunch Online Meetup #18: Connecting Cassandra to Kafka**
    - Guest speaker, Ryan Quey, a full stack data engineer, discusses a personal project he has been working on called java-podcast-processor, which is a tool to find podcast metadata over an external API, store them, get their RSS feeds, and run ETL using Airflow, Kafka, Spark, and Cassandra. The particular Cassandra distribution used is Elassandra, which allows seamless integration with Elasticsearch. The data is also displayed using a Gatsby app and served using Flask.

- **Apache Cassandra Lunch Online Meetup #19: Combined Use of Relational Databases and Apache Cassandra**
    - We discuss the combined use of relational databases and Cassandra. We also discuss the advantages of using relational databases and Cassandra separately; as well as, covering the advantages and methods for using both concurrently.

- **Apache Cassandra Lunch Online Meetup #20: Cassandra Read / Write Path**
    - We discuss Cassandra read and write paths, which is how Cassandra stores and retrieves data at high speeds. We do not cover how Cassandra replicates data because that its own subject, but we take a look at these four sub-topics: Write Path, Update / Delete, Maintenance Path, and Read Path.

- **Apache Cassandra Lunch Online Meetup #21: Cassandra Stages / Thread Pools**
    - We discuss Cassandra and Staged Event-Driven Architecture with an emphasis on Cassandra stages / thread pools. We also discuss a few different tools that we can use to monitor these stages and thread pools in order to keep your Cassandra running as smoothly as possible.
